**Thyroid Disorder Prediction
**
This project aims to predict thyroid disorders, particularly hypothyroidism, using machine learning models. The project includes data preprocessing, logistic regression modeling, and a Streamlit-based web application for interactive analysis and visualization.

**Project Overview
**
Thyroid disorders, especially hypothyroidism, are common conditions where the thyroid gland is underactive, leading to various health issues. This project uses a dataset containing patient information and laboratory results to predict the likelihood of thyroid disorders.
